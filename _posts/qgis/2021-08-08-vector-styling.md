To create a map, one has to style the GIS data and present it in a form that is visually informative and also pleasing. There are a large number of options available in QGIS to apply different types of symbology to the underlying data. In this tutorial, we will take a text file and apply different data visualization techniques to highlight spatial patterns in the data.

#### The tutorial consists of the following steps:

### 1. Download data
In this tutorial we will use [<span style="color:#0564A0">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</span>](http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication). Scroll down and find World Heritage List in XLS format. Download the file and open in Excel. Save the file as csv-file `File â–º Save As` and name it <span style="font-family:Consolas; color:#AF1B03">whc_sites_2021.csv</span> and choose file type as CSV (Comma delimited).
We will also need country borders. Download the [<span style="color:#0564A0">countries</span>](https://http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip) and extract to your working folder.

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of datasets from the link below:

Data Source:
World Heritage List from [<span style="color:#0564A0">World Heritage List</span>](http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication) and country borders from [<span style="color:#0564A0">Natural Earth</span>](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
