To create a map, one has to style the GIS data and present it in a form that is visually informative and also pleasing. There are a large number of options available in QGIS to apply different types of symbology to the underlying data. In this tutorial, we will take a text file and apply different data visualization techniques to highlight spatial patterns in the data.

#### The tutorial consists of the following steps:

### 1. Download data
Natural Earth provides a [<span style="color:#0564A0">Populated Places</span>](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-populated-places/) dataset. Download the [<span style="color:#0564A0">simple (less columns) dataset</span>](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip). Extract the dataset to your working folder.

For convenience, you may directly download a copy of datasets from the link below:
[<span style="color:#0564A0">ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip</span>](../../datasets/ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip)

Data Source:
World Heritage List from [<span style="color:#0564A0">World Heritage List</span>](http://whc.unesco.org/en/syndication) and country borders from [<span style="color:#0564A0">Natural Earth</span>](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
