We will use the Natural Earth dataset - specifically the Natural Earth Quick Start Kit that comes with beautifully styled global layers that can be loaded directly to QGIS.

Download the [<span style="color:#0564A0">Natural Earth Quickstart Kit</span>](https://naciscdn.org/naturalearth/packages/Natural_Earth_quick_start.zip). If the download link doesnâ€™t work, get it directly from Natural Earth Downloads page.
