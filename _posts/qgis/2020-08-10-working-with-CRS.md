Coordinate Reference System (CRS) often cause a lot of frustration when working with GIS data. But a proper understanding of the concepts and access to the right tools will make it much easier to deal with projections. Coordinate Reference Systems, also referred to as Spatial Reference Systems, include two common types:
+ Geographic Coordinate Sytems (GCS)
+ Projected Coordinate Systems (PCS)

In this tutorial, we will explore how CRSs work in QGIS and learn about tools available for vector and raster data layers.

#### The tutorial consists of the following steps:

- [1. Download data](#1-download-data)
- [2. Steps to make a map](#2-steps-to-make-a-map)

### 1. Download data

We will use the Natural Earth dataset - specifically the Natural Earth Quick Start Kit that comes with beautifully styled global layers that can be loaded directly to QGIS.

Download the [<span style="color:#0564A0">Natural Earth Quickstart Kit</span>](https://naciscdn.org/naturalearth/packages/Natural_Earth_quick_start.zip). If the download link doesnâ€™t work, get it directly from Natural Earth Downloads page.
